Idea is:
during the month any income earned goes into a NatWest account
On the first monday of the next month (when interest is paid):
* move all left over-funds from Monzo to NatWest
* Move 80% from the account to Monzo
    - this leaves 20% extra each month
    - effectively compound saving for my emergency fund
    - leave in NatWest for the interest rate (currently 1.5%)
* using 10% from my monzo account, buy something like cryptocurrencies
    - high risk, high reward
    - if it doesn't go up, it's only 10%
    - if it does, I've made a bit of money
* using 40% from my monzo account, invest into low - mid stuff
    - bonds mainly
    - and equities
    - Currently I'm paying a robo-advisor (like AI, but barely AI) to do this for me
    - it diverisifes it really well and I don't any fees on the first 5k
    - it may not be optimal but it works and I don't know enough about investing to comftorably do it myself
    - Also the founder checks out as a sound guy, he's not looking to make money he's more into
    - "Wow this is a really cool problem we can work on"
    - Only 30% of my bonds are UK based so if Brexit causes mayhem it should be okay :)
* put some of the rest of the money into pots like holiday, christmas etc
    - using IFFT automate a weekly amount to be moved from a pot to my account

most of this isn't automated yet, but OpenBanking is a thing now, imagine if this was possible

Ideas for this app:
* I currently have IFFT set up to auto-track all my Monzo expenses in google sheets
    - would be cool if I could have a sumary in this program
* Log all my income into a google sheets
    - have the summary here also
    - for tax purposes too
* Rate me on how good I did this 
* track my browser usage to see if I actually use the subscriptions I'm subscribed to
* Look at peer-to-peer lending
* Read Tim Hales book on investing
* Consider getting a Vanguard ETF next tax year
* Correlate FitBit data with Monzo data
    - I have a suspicion that when I don't work out on a day I spend more on chocolate
    - we can prove this using FitBit data
